# Health Insurance Cost Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict health insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region. The model is built using Python and various data science libraries.
## Introduction

Health insurance cost prediction is an important task for insurance companies to offer competitive premiums while ensuring profitability. This project aims to create a model that accurately predicts insurance costs using a dataset containing various demographic and health-related features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- `age`: Age of the individual
- `sex`: Gender of the individual (male/female)
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
- `smoker`: Smoking status (yes/no)
- `region`: Region where the individual resides (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
- `charges`: Medical costs billed by health insurance

The dataset can be found as `insurance.csv`.
